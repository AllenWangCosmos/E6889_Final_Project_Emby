Columbia University 2024 Spring ELENE 6889 Final Project: Emby Server Service Application Development

The rapid growth of digital streaming services has resulted in the vast accumulation of user interaction data, posing both challenges and opportunities for enhancing media recommendation systems. This research focuses on constructing a data-driven analysis service by utilizing playback history logs from the Emby server. The principal objective is to deepen our comprehension of user behaviors and preferences, with a specific emphasis on identifying consumption patterns of movies and TV series. Through meticulous analysis and processing of this data, the study aims to develop user preference statistics and media recommendations under streaming scenario, thereby substantially improving the user experience.
